*Shows your sandbox version next to your sandbox host*

Tired of having to manually look at what version your sandboxes are?  Well, let a computer do all that tedious work for you!  This extension will load an icon and alt text next to your instance name so you can see if the sandbox is a spring/summer/winter instance.
